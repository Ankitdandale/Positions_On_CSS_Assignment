Question 2 ) : Explain the difference between Absolute and Relative positioning.

Answer : 
 
*Absolute :
           1)With relative Postioning ,an element can be moved up,down,left or right
             from its normal position.
           2)It will not break the normal document flow to position the element on the 
             page.
           3)The element will leave the space at its original postion & other content
             will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.
           4) Syntax :
                      {
                         position:absolute;
                      }

*Relative :
           1)With absolute positioning ,an element is positioned relative to its 
            nearest positioned ancestor.
           2)It will break the normal document flow to position the element on the
             page.
           3)The element will not leave any space in its original position.
           4)Syntax :
                     {
                      position:relative;
                     }
